# Advanced Array methods

## The map method and the reduce method

### This is a demo project that attempts to cover the usage of two advanced array methods.

- array.map
- array.reduce.

The project will run in a browser through the index.html file.
simply clone the project to your local environment and depending upon your local set up
run a web server and point it at the index.html file.
For example, if you are using VSCode:

- [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)

- [The Reduce method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce)

This project is by no means a production ready, optimised project. It merely attempts to decipher two very useful
array methods that are essential for web developers. There is also a pdf of the presentation used to explain the methods.

I hope you find it useful!
